      <description>Recently I decided to revive my old domain, withonlyamap.com. It&amp;rsquo;s been a hobby domain for a while but fell to the wayside. Anyway, I had the idea to start using it again to share mostly music I enjoy. I may also write about photography, scientific topics, and general life updates.
As a bit of personal news, I&amp;rsquo;m currently on paternity leave as my wife, and I had a daughter earlier this month.</description>
