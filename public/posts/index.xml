      <description>Recently I decided to revive this site. I gave it a new face using hugo, which I find to be more of a pleeasure to use than Jekyll as of late.
My future plans for this site will be to write and share about music, books, and science. It&amp;rsquo;s an effort to go back to the way things were prior to joining the tech industry.
I&amp;rsquo;m also working to get ash//tephra up and going finally.</description>
