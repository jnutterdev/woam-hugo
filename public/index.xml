      <description>Recently I decided to revive my old domain, withonlyamap.com. It&amp;rsquo;s been a hobby domain for a while but fell to the wayside. Anyway, I had the idea to start using it again to share mostly music I enjoy. I may also write about photography, scientific topics, and general life updates.
As a bit of personal news, I&amp;rsquo;m currently on paternity leave as my wife, and I had a daughter earlier this month.</description>

      <description>Hi there, I&amp;rsquo;m John Nutter, and I find many things interesting. I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer by trade, a Father of two, and live in Decatur, GA, with my wife. When I&amp;rsquo;m not working on websites, I create things musically and discover new things about the world around me. withonlyamap.com is mainly an outlet for writing about what I make and learn about, so I can share with a few more folks.</description>
