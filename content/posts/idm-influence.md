This time, I wanted to talk about another genre of music: IDM. It's a genre that's been around since the mid 90s and fused various electronic elements such as breakbeat, acid, electro, and techo. Warp records, while not the first label, but was certainly a driving force for releasing IDM. Some of the bigger names would be Aphex Twin, Autechre, and Squarepusher to name just a few.
