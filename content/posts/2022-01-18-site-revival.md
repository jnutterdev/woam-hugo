Recently I decided to revive my old domain, withonlyamap.com. It's been a hobby domain for a while but fell to the wayside. Anyway, I had the idea to start using it again to share mostly music I enjoy. I may also write about photography, scientific topics, and general life updates. 

As a bit of personal news, I'm currently on paternity leave as my wife and I had a daughter earlier this month. Her name is Lucia, and she is the light of my life. I figured now is the best time to reconnect with my hobbies as I will have some time on my hands for a couple of months. 


I've got a couple of other projects I plan to work on as well: 

- [ashtephra.com](https://ashtephra.com): a music label that I've kicked around for the last 10 or so years. It's mostly a digital-only outlet for personal music. Still, I may expand to cassette tapes or even other artists. We'll see. 

- [longlostforgotten.com](https://longlostforgotten.com): this is another hobby project I started a long time ago. I'm not sure what I will use it for, but I wanted to reclaim it. In the interim, I plan on hosting a website I created back in 2004 just to have for posterity's sake.  

I also plan to post some playlists of top albums/songs/artists I like, so stay tuned for those. In the meantime, I'm currently listening to Melt by Blank Gloss, which can be found here:
