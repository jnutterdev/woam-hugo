I first got into post-rock sometime between 1999 and 2000--I've been listening to the genre ever since. I have a particular interest in it Post-rock is also a genre that I sort of stumbled on my own without the help or influence of anyone, and gradually grew into it more. 

The following playlist is sort of a favorites put together over the years. While most of it is more on the ambient side of the post-rock, there's a few songs mixed in that I feel are post-rock adjacent and have shaped my tastes in some way. 


1. Slow Riot for New Zero Kanada - Godspeed You! Black Emperor
    Probably one of the most quintessential post-rock groups out there. A collective of muscicians from Canada
