Recently I decided to revive this site. I gave it a new face using [hugo](https://gohugo.io), which I find to be more of a pleeasure to use than [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as of late. 

My future plans for this site will be to write and share about music, books, and science. It's an effort to go back to the way things were prior to joining the tech industry. 

I'm also working to get ash//tephra up and going finally. It will probably be a soft launch with some older material for now until I can get some newer tracks wrapped. This is tentative at the moment, however. 

I recently reacquired an older domain of mine, longlostforgotten.com. I'm not sure exactly what I plan on doing with it yet but I'll update the activity here once I have a clearer picture. Here's a list of all my domains:

- [withonlyamap.com](https://www.withonlyamap.com) : Personal blogging site
- [terribledevice.com](https://www.terribledevice.com) : Blogging site for music production topics
- [ash//tephra](https://www.ashtephra.com) : Record label based out of Decatur, GA that focuses on experimental electronic, ambient, shoegaze, and post-rock music.
- [jnutterdev](https://www.jnutterdev.com) : Website for web developmnt portfolio
- [longlostforgotten](https://www.longlostforgotten.com) : TBD

On a personal note, my wife and I recently had our second child Lucia. Hard to believe it's been two weeks already.
