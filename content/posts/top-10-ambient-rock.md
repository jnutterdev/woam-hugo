# Top 10 ambient/post-rock albums

I first got into post-rock around 1999 and have been listening ever since. Post-rock is also a genre that I sort of stumbled on my own without the help or influence of anyone, and gradually grew into it more. 

The following playlist is sort of a favorites put together over the years. While most of it is more on the ambient side of the post-rock, there's a few songs mixed in that I feel are post-rock adjacent and have shaped my tastes in some way.
