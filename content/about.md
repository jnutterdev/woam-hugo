Hi there, I'm John Nutter, and I find many things interesting. I'm a software engineer by trade, a Father of two, and live in Decatur, GA, with my wife. When I'm not working on websites, I create things musically and discover new things about the world around me. withonlyamap.com is mainly an outlet for writing about what I make and learn about, so I can share with a few more folks.
